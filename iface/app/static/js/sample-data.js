It provides a fascinating account of his intellectual and political                 itinerary before <I>Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</I>                 (1972), the ground-breaking book he wrote with Gilles Deleuze, propelled him to the                 forefront of contemporary French philosophy. </P><P>Guattari's                 background was unlike that of any of his peers. In 1953, with psychoanalyst Jean                 Oury, he founded the La Borde psychiatric clinic, which was based on the principle                 that one cannot treat psychotics without modifying the entire institutional context.                 For Guattari, the purpose of \"institutional psychotherapy\" was not just to                 cure psychotic patients, but also to learn with them a different relation to the                 world. A dissident in the French Communist Party and active in far-left politics (he                 participated in the May 1968 student rebellion), Guattari realized early on that it                 was possible to introduce analysis into political groups. Considered as open                 machines (subject-groups) rather than self-contained structures (subjugated groups),                 these subject-groups shunned hierarchy and vertical structures, developing                 transversally, rhizomatizing through other groups. </P><P>                 <I>Psychoanalysis and Transversality</I> collects twenty-four essays by                 Guattari, including his foundational 1964 article on transversality, and a superb                 introduction by Gilles Deleuze, \"Three Group-Related Problems.\"</P>",
